### About me :rocket:

I am a Statistician and Data Scientist with over 5 years of experience applying statistical learning and advanced analytics in the financial services industry. My professional background spans quantitative research, credit risk, consulting, and marketing analytics — where I’ve delivered data-driven solutions that support strategic decision-making and regulatory compliance.

With a strong foundation in statistics and applied mathematics, I bring both theoretical rigor and practical expertise to my work. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Wichita State University, where my research focuses on mathematical finance, econometrics, causal inference, and interpretable machine learning.
