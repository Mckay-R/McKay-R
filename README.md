### Hi, I'm Kayode Oyeniran ðŸ‘‹

I am a Statistician & Data Scientist. My work revolves around statistical learning, risk management, and customer analytics. I have worked as a data professional for more than 5 years in retail, credit risk, consulting, environmental risk, and marketing. 

I have a strong background in statistics with experience in the financial services. I have developed a keen understading of the complex statistical models. I am currently leveraging data at one of the leading financial institutions in the US. I guess at this point you can call me a data nerd ðŸ˜Ž.
